# C-FORM

A comprehensive formatting and style guide for C and Assembly programming.

## Overview

C-FORM is a code formatting guide that treats source code as a low-level textbook. It emphasizes clarity, readability, and educational value in code formatting. The style is intentionally spacious to reduce cognitive load and make complex systems more approachable.

## Focal Points

- **Educational Focus**: Comments are written in a conversational, easy-to-understand manner
- **Clear Structure**: Consistent formatting rules for both C and Assembly code
- **Documentation-First**: Emphasizes self-documenting code with detailed explanations
- **Readability**: Spacious formatting that reduces cognitive load
- **Hardware Understanding**: Special attention to documenting hardware interactions and low-level concepts

### For C
- Standard libraries included first, followed by project headers
- Right-aligned ASM-style comments
- Vertically aligned comment braces
- Clear separation of global variables and functions
- Structured documentation blocks

### For Assembly
- Clean block separation with blank lines
- Labels at column 0
- Indented instructions and directives
- Detailed comments explaining hardware interactions
- Consistent uppercase comments for register operations
